## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life Cycle
The Gantt Chart used to describe and document the project management life cycle enables QTMT personnel to sometimes adhere to the rules and reach the milestone. The project life cycle WBS divides each member's role and work into several modules, including the project manager's. Based on the created WBS, each member has their own duties and contributions to make at each point of the lifecycle.

The Gantt Chart below shows the project management WBS:

### Scope
To map all relevant activities and build the process, a work breakdown structure (WBS) is built. The WBS will be updated and approved.

Our research intends to create a chatbot for mental health that can comprehend and evaluate a person's mental health through natural language interaction. The chatbot will be able to help people identify and obtain the assistance they require in a discrete, private, and user-friendly manner after being educated on various mental health datasets. The goal is to develop a tool that can help in early detection, management, and treatment of mental health issues while also enhancing overall mental health outcomes. The chatbot will be created to respect user privacy and offer a secure forum for people to talk about their mental health issues.
