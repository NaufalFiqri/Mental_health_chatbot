# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## B. PLANNING THE PROJECT

### Project Management Life Cycle
The Gantt Chart used to describe and document the project management life cycle enables QTMT personnel to sometimes adhere to the rules and reach the milestone. The project life cycle WBS divides each member's role and work into several modules, including the project manager's. Based on the created WBS, each member has their own duties and contributions to make at each point of the lifecycle.

The Gantt Chart below shows the project management WBS:

### Scope
To map all relevant activities and build the process, a work breakdown structure (WBS) is built. The WBS will be updated and approved.

Our research intends to create a chatbot for mental health that can comprehend and evaluate a person's mental health through natural language interaction. The chatbot will be able to help people identify and obtain the assistance they require in a discrete, private, and user-friendly manner after being educated on various mental health datasets. The goal is to develop a tool that can help in early detection, management, and treatment of mental health issues while also enhancing overall mental health outcomes. The chatbot will be created to respect user privacy and offer a secure forum for people to talk about their mental health issues.

### Risk Identification Chart (Quality, Cost, Time)

| Control Element | What is likely to go wrong? | How and when will I know? | What will I do about it? |
|-----|----|-------|-----|
|Quality <br> (A poor quality mindset, poor design, poor materials, poor craftsmanship, and a weak quality assurance programme)|
|Cost <br> (Errors in estimation; insufficient productivity, cost, change, or contingency)|
|Time <br> (Flawed allocation and management of float, early release of rival goods, flaws in forecasting time or resource availability, problems in identifying the critical route.)|

| Risk Manager | Aina Syazzween | The project's risk management and tracking responsibilities fall within the purview of the risk manager. In order to guarantee that prime contractor risk management initiatives do not negatively affect the project, the risk manager also keeps an eye on them. The project's risk manager oversees risk identification sessions, monitors prime contractor risk management efforts, and takes part in division-level risk management activities for risks that cross project boundaries or are outside the scope of the project. The risk manager also manages and tracks potential and active risks, maintains the risk management tool and documentation information. <br><br> Every risk associated with this project must be listed. For instance, the team must identify the emotion in an image for the Mental Health Chatbot project. If the team randomly takes pictures of people without asking their permission, this session might be risky. As a result, the team will consider potential solutions to this challenge. <br><br> Unexpected issues might arise at any stage of this endeavour. Therefore, the risk management must record every danger so that they can prevent it and take precautions to ensure that specific issue won't arise.|
| Administrative Manager | Aina Syazzween | In charge of administration The Administrative Manager leads the cost management effort, including sponsoring cost budgeting and tracking activities, facilitating communication on financial status, and ensuring the project cost tool and supporting documentation is maintained.
