# PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION

## Deliverable
This project focuses on building a Mental Health Chatbot for RELATE Malaysia in a form of a Desktop Application for users. The deliverables are as following:
1. A human-like chatbot that can be used for answering question related to mental health, mainly for mental health awareness.
2. Able to give suggestions based on user’s mental health condition.

## Software Requirement
The main software used for building this project is any integrated development environment that can be used for python language such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code or PyCharm. Other than that, this project uses python packages and those are Tkinter for graphical user interface, Javascript Object Notation (JSON) to keep training and testing data, PyTorch and Numpy to deal with the neural network. 

## Intelligent System Architecture
There are three main ways to build a chatbot and those are using Machine Learning method of Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes and Neural Network Deep Learning. As for this project, the Intelligent system architecture used is the Deep Learning with 8 hidden layers. This model also uses 1000 epochs with learning rate of 0.001. 
 
## Outcomes of the system
This system should receive an input from the user in order for it to react with certain response. It recognizes the user’s queries based on the tag words trained.
